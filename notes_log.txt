# What works and what not

1) The drivers initialize, but they probably mess something up somewhere, not sure where (K_ERR_CPU_EXCEPTION).
2) CONFIG_NET_QEMU_VIRTIO=n fixes the halting -> <err> eth_virtio_net: vnet_dev_init: vdev null is thrown (obviously)
3) the issue is likely to be with eth_virtio_net.c
